### Additional Notes:
Gabriel is often found in a secluded corner of Kent St, surrounded by holographic displays and mumbling to himself as he works on complex algorithms. He has a habit of anthropomorphizing his AI creations, giving them names and distinct personalities. Despite his digital focus, Gabriel keeps a worn, paper notebook where he sketches out his most groundbreaking ideas, believing that some things are too important to risk being hacked or digitally stolen.
