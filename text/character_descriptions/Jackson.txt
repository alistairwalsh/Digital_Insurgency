Jackson is the enigmatic bouncer, a towering figure with a shaved head and an imposing presence. 
His stoic demeanor and intense gaze make him an intimidating force, but his loyalty to the bar 
and its patrons is unwavering. Jackson keeps an eye out for trouble, ensuring the safety of those within 
the bar's walls, and discreetly assists Nisha and Ren by providing backup when needed.
