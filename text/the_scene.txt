Kent Street Dive Bar is a gritty and dimly lit establishment tucked away in the heart of the city. Its worn-down exterior and flickering neon sign give it an air of secrecy and exclusivity. Inside, the bar exudes an atmosphere of rebellion and camaraderie, drawing a diverse crowd of rebels, hackers, artists, and those seeking refuge from the oppressive regime.

The bar itself is lined with a weathered, scarred counter, where patrons gather to order drinks and engage in spirited conversations. The walls are adorned with graffiti, posters of underground movements, and flickering vintage screens displaying old cyberpunk films. The music pulsates through the speakers, featuring a mix of rebellious punk, electronic beats, and the occasional live band performing on a small stage in the corner.

Behind the counter, a few staff members keep the bar running smoothly:
Max, Jackson and Lena


Kent Street Dive Bar serves as a sanctuary for the city's misfits and rebels, providing a space where like-minded individuals can gather, share information, and plot against the oppressive regime. It's a place where secrets are exchanged, alliances are formed, and the resistance gains strength.
